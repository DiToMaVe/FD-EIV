# fd-eiv
Identification of errors–in–variables (EIV) models corrupted by additive and uncorrelated  white  noise. The  noise–free input is  an arbitrary signal, not necessarily periodic. A frequency domain method is used, under the assumption that the ratio of the noise variances is known.

EIV identification problem is addressed by applying the Koopmans–Levin approach in the frequency domain. The system is described by a parametric model that links the Discrete  Fourier  Transforms  (DFTs) of  the  input  and  output  signals. The extended model (incorporating the transient term) allows to deal with shorter data sequences and arbitrary input signals.
